      <p>There are millions of ways to combine any sort of passion of your with technology no matter what it is.
        A passion of mine that I combined with computer science is environmental science. One way I would like to implement
        computer science with environmental science is doing something for the ocean and the plastic. I would like to develop
        a machine that could clean out the plastics and clean up the toxins.</p>

      <p>One design that was made to help out the environment is the Tesla Car reduce the environmental impacts
        of transportation, electricity production and energy use by society. Creating robots or machines to clean up
        the water is another example of implementing computer science in the environment. A 12 year old girl, Anna Du,
        created a ROV that can maneuver through the water and pick up plastics on the ocean floor.
